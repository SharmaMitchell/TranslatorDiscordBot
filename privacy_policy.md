# Privacy Policy for KomiBot Translator

Effective Date: March 15, 2025

Note that this pertains to the **KomiBot** (KomiBot#0692) Discord application owned and operated by [@SharmaMitchell](https://github.com/SharmaMitchell). Forks and derivitives may vary.

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines how **KomiBot**, a Discord translation bot, collects, uses, and protects your information when you interact with the bot. By using the bot, you agree to the collection and use of data as described in this policy.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Translation Requests
When you use the `!translate` or `!tl` command, the bot processes the message or content you provide for translation. This data includes the text to be translated, the source and target languages, and the server/channel where the translation request was made. **Note: The bot does not store the content of your messages.** Translations are processed in real-time via DeepL (See [API Usage](#api-usage)). 

### Message Count Tracking
While the bot does not store any individual messages or translation content, it does track the **total number of translations** that have been processed. This count is stored in a text file for the sole purpose of maintaining the number of translations processed. The count is updated each time a translation request is made, but the bot does not retain any specific data regarding the content or details of those requests.

### API Usage
The bot uses the **DeepL API** for translation services. When you send a translation request, the text is sent to DeepL servers to perform the translation. Please refer to [DeepL’s Privacy Policy](https://support.deepl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020556980-Privacy-Data-protection) for more information on how they handle data.

## Data Retention
The bot does not store the content of translation requests. However, it does retain a count of the number of translations processed, which is stored in a text file. This data is updated each time a translation is processed but does not include any personal information or content of the translations themselves.

## Data Security
The bot uses standard industry practices to secure the data it processes. However, please be aware that no method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Third-Party Services
KomiBot uses **DeepL API** for translations. By using the bot, you acknowledge that translation data is processed by DeepL’s servers. Please refer to their privacy policy for information about their data handling practices.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated through an update to this document. The updated policy will be effective as of the date specified at the top of this page.
