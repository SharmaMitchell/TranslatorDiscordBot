Effective Date: March 15, 2025

Note that this pertains to the **KomiBot** (KomiBot#0692) Discord application owned and operated by [@SharmaMitchell](https://github.com/SharmaMitchell). Forks and derivitives may vary.

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines how **KomiBot**, a Discord translation bot, collects, uses, and protects your information when you interact with the bot. By using the bot, you agree to the collection and use of data as described in this policy.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Translation Requests
When you use the `!translate` or `!tl` command, the bot processes the message or content you provide for translation. This data includes the text to be translated, the source and target languages, and the server/channel where the translation request was made. 

### Log Data
To ensure the bot operates smoothly and to debug potential issues, translation requests are logged. The following data is recorded for each translation request:
- **User**: The user who requested the translation.
- **Server**: The Discord server where the request was made.
- **Channel**: The channel where the request was made.
- **Source Language**: The original language of the text.
- **Target Language**: The language to which the text is being translated.
- **Translated Text**: The text that was translated.
- **Timestamp**: The time of the translation request.

This data is stored in a CSV file located on the server for debugging purposes.

### API Usage
The bot uses the **DeepL API** for translation services. When you send a translation request, the text is sent to DeepL servers to perform the translation. Please refer to [DeepL’s Privacy Policy](https://support.deepl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020556980-Privacy-Data-protection) for more information on how they handle data.

## Data Retention
Log data is stored indefinitely for debugging and operational purposes.

## Data Security
The bot uses standard industry practices to secure your data. However, please be aware that no method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Third-Party Services
KomiBot uses **DeepL API** for translations. By using the bot, you acknowledge that translation data is processed by DeepL’s servers. Please refer to their privacy policy for information about their data handling practices.
